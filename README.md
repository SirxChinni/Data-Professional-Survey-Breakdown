# ðŸ“Š Data Professional Survey Breakdown - Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into a survey conducted among data professionals. The dataset includes details such as job roles, salaries, demographics, work satisfaction, and career preferences.
## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
1. Removed Unnecessary Columns

- Dropped irrelevant fields (e.g., ID fields, redundant information).

2. Converted Salary Ranges to Numeric Values

- The dataset had salary ranges (e.g., 100k - 150k).
- Standardized salaries by calculating the average of the lower and upper bounds (e.g., 125k).
